REST demo in Flask using Flask-RESTful, Flask-JWT, Flask-SQLAlchemy. Tests using Postman.

## REST Principle

 * One PATH, multiple VERBS operating on same resource. Similar to object oriented programming.
 * Sigular vs Plural.
 * REST is stateless. The server only knows about current request, not past or next.

## API Best Practices

 * When method is already GET, don't name any endpoint like, /getstudent
